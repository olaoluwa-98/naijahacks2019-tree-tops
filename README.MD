### Problem Statement:
Several students have a strong desire to attain an expected high grade, although they are plagued with the challenge of tackling specific-domain courses they are weak at (e.g. student performs poorly in mathematics-related courses e.t.c). In the existence of such a challenge, attaining their expected grade becomes almost an impossible task for the student.

Hence it's important there could be a system for universities (which could be adopted by counseling units) to provide grade recommendation while leveraging on their area of strength rather than weakness.

### Solution:
Build a platform that should be able to generate a very suitable grade recommendation for the student by leveraging on an existing grade recommendation algorithm (baked in with support for user preferences) based on the following parameters:
 - Current university (their university must have signed up on our platform)
 - A course of study,
 - Current GPA,
 - Current academic level,
 - Target GPA, and 
 - Areas of weakness.
